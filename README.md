<h2>Hello AllðŸ‘‹</h2>, This is one of my Mini-project name --> <h2>Single digit up counter</h2> (count from 0 to 9).
<br>
<br>
I have created this with 2 different methods in javascript. Here is some intro regarding this project.
<br>
You might have seen a timer on some web sites or at least on your phone. We are also going to create a wonderful timer ourselves.
The counter starts from zero and ends at some number which the user enters in the input. The input only takes a number.
